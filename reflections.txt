Your response goes here!

I've learned a bit about how to do superscript and how to link directly to other
elements within the page, although I didn't get a chance to impliment that here.

So far a lot of this I went over before so it's all been pretty easy.

I haven't run into anyting too difficult yet!

I did a little bit of googling, I ran my code through an HTML validator and it
said that <strike></strike> was obsolete and I couldn't remember how to add css
inline, and I browsed around the documentation for a few other things I came
across
